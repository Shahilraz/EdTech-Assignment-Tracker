📘 EdTech Assignment Tracker
A simplified assignment tracking system for an EdTech platform. This project includes a complete system design and a functional frontend prototype demonstrating core features like role-based access, assignment creation, and submission tracking.

🧩 1. Objective
To design and implement a minimal assignment tracking system where:

Teachers can post assignments.

Students can submit solutions.

Role-based access control ensures secure operations.

🏗️ 2. System Design
2.1 Architecture Overview
Client (Frontend):
Responsive web interface using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. Handles user interaction and communicates via REST APIs.

Server (Backend):
RESTful API built with Python using frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, or Django. Manages authentication, authorization, and business logic.

Database:
Relational database (PostgreSQL for production or SQLite for development) for persistent data storage.

2.2 Core Entities and Relationships
Entity	Fields	Description
User	id, username, password_hash, role ('teacher' or 'student')	Represents a platform user
Assignment	id, title, description, created_at, teacher_id	Created by teachers
Submission	id, content, submitted_at, assignment_id, student_id	Submitted by students for an assignment

Relationships:
A Teacher can create many Assignments.

An Assignment can have many Submissions.

A Student can submit multiple Submissions.

2.3 API Endpoint Definitions
✅ Teacher Creates an Assignment
Endpoint: POST /api/assignments

Role: Teacher

Request Body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "title": "Introduction to Python",
  "description": "Write a function that returns 'hello world'."
}
📝 Student Submits an Assignment
Endpoint: POST /api/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions

Role: Student

Request Body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "content": "def hello():\n  return 'hello world'"
}
📂 Teacher Views Submissions
Endpoint: GET /api/assignments/{assignment_id}/submissions

Role: Teacher

Description: Fetches all submissions for a specific assignment.

2.4 Authentication Strategy
Token-Based Authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

User's role is encoded in the token.

Backend middleware authorizes access based on role.

💻 3. Prototype Implementation
A self-contained frontend prototype is provided in the index.html file.

3.1 Tech Stack
HTML5

Tailwind CSS (Styling)

JavaScript (ES6) (UI logic and mock API simulation)

3.2 How to Run the Prototype
Copy the content of index.html.

Create a file using a code editor (e.g., VS Code).

Paste the code and save it as index.html.

Open in Browser:

Right-click → "Open with Live Server" (if installed)

Or open index.html directly in any browser.
